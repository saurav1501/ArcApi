<P class="p3 ft4">BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE FULLY AWARE OF AND AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND PROVISIONS, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE CONSULTED WITH AN ATTORNEY ABOUT YOUR RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AND YOU ARE HEREBY ENTERING INTO A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT.</P>

<P class="p5 ft6">This Certification Agreement (this “<SPAN class="ft5">Agreement</SPAN>”) is entered into by You (as defined below) and the Green Business Certification Inc. (“<SPAN class="ft5">GBCI</SPAN>”), a non-profit corporation of the District of Columbia located at 2101 L Street, NW, Suite 500, Washington, DC 20037, and constitutes a binding agreement between You, on the one hand, and GBCI, on the other hand. As used herein, the terms “<SPAN class="ft5">You</SPAN>,” “<SPAN class="ft5">Your</SPAN>,” “<SPAN class="ft5">Yourself</SPAN>,” and “<SPAN class="ft5">Owner</SPAN>” refer to the individual(s) or entity(ies) that holds all legal right to possess and control the real and personal property associated with the Project (defined below) and that is executing this Agreement, as may be implemented by a third party such as an architect, property manager or consultant who has been granted authority to act on Your behalf (Your “<SPAN class="ft5">Agent</SPAN>”). </P>

<P class="p5 ft6">If Your Agent is entering into this Agreement on Your behalf, You represent and warrant that You have completed a “<SPAN class="ft5">Confirmation of Agent’s Authority</SPAN>” (the form of which is available online at <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/resources/agent-authority" target="_blank">http://www.usgbc.org/resources/agent-authority</a>) and that You or Your Agent will provide this form to GBCI upon execution of this Agreement. In such instance, GBCI shall have no obligation to render any decision or provide any other information with respect to the precertification or LEED<SPAN class="ft7">®</SPAN> Certification of any Project registered under this Agreement until You have provided this form to GBCI. GBCI agrees that Your Agent has no responsibility for the breach of any contractual obligations arising from the Agent’s authorized conduct on Your behalf. Any attempt to modify the terms of the Confirmation of Agent’s Authority may render the form invalid as to be determined by GBCI in GBCI’s sole discretion.</P>

<P class="p5 ft6">If more than one person or entity constitutes an Owner as defined herein, such parties must irrevocably designate You as the sole Owner with the authority to accept this Agreement and work directly with GBCI for the purpose of administering the LEED Certification process (the “<SPAN class="ft5">Primary Owner</SPAN>”). GBCI will only communicate with and take direction from You as the Primary Owner with regard to the performance of GBCI’s obligations under this Agreement.</P>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">1. PURPOSE.</SPAN> The purpose of this Agreement is to establish the terms and conditions of the LEED Certification Program (the “Program,”) to which You (and Your Agent, if any) are bound.</P>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">2. THE PROGRAM.</SPAN> The Program consists of the process whereby GBCI reviews documentation submitted by participants to determine if a building, interior space or neighborhood, as described to GBCI, complies with the requirements of the LEED Green Building Rating System, and has accumulated the minimum number of points necessary to achieve precertification or a particular level of LEED Certification (i.e., LEED Certified™, LEED Silver<SPAN class="ft7">®</SPAN>, LEED Gold<SPAN class="ft7">®</SPAN> or LEED Platinum<SPAN class="ft7">®</SPAN>). GBCI administers the Program and confers precertification and LEED Certification under license from the U.S. Green Building Council, Inc. (“<SPAN class="ft5">USGBC</SPAN>”). </P>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">3. THE PROJECT.</SPAN> </P>

<dl class="dlNumber">
	<dt>3.1</dt><dd><P class="ft6">As used herein, the term “<SPAN class="ft5">Project</SPAN>” refers to the real and personal property (including the buildings, space(s), structure(s), land, fixtures, etc.) comprising the single-family home(s), multi-family residential building(s), commercial building(s), commercial interior space(s), neighborhood development, or as identified conceptually in the neighborhood development plan or Prototype that You register under this Agreement for the purpose of seeking precertification or LEED Certification, whichever the case may be. The format of Your Project and the number of buildings and interior spaces which may encompass Your Project, and to which this Agreement will apply, may vary depending on the manner in which You pursue precertification or LEED Certification. </P></dd>
	
	<dt>3.2</dt><dd><P class="ft6">If You are participating in the Volume Program and intend to certify multiple buildings or interior spaces under this Agreement via a Prototype, the term “<SPAN class="ft5">Project</SPAN>” refers to the Prototype you hereby register and to each of the buildings or interior spaces (“<SPAN class="ft5">Volume Projects</SPAN>”) that you register in the future associated with this Prototype. The term “<SPAN class="ft5">Prototype</SPAN>” refers to the conceptual building model or certification framework demonstrating the common design and construction elements or operations and maintenance practices, as well as quality management processes, which will be incorporated, applied and followed in the implementation of all associated “Volume Projects.” While Your Prototype may be submitted for precertification review, it does not represent an actual building or interior space and cannot be independently awarded LEED Certification.</P></dd>
	
	<dt>3.3</dt><dd><P class="ft6">If You are pursuing certification via the campus approach and intend to certify multiple buildings or interior spaces within a campus environment through the registration and submission of one or more Master Sites, the term “<SPAN class="ft5">Project</SPAN>” refers to each of the buildings and interior spaces (“<SPAN class="ft5">Campus Projects</SPAN>”) and each of the Master Sites that you register in the future under this Agreement. The term “<SPAN class="ft5">Master Site</SPAN>” refers to a separately registered and submitted Project consisting of a partial Application designed to represent certain common aspects of numerous buildings or interior spaces within a campus for which LEED Certification is sought. While Master Sites may be submitted for review, they are grouping tools rather than complete applications for the associated building(s) or interior space(s) and cannot be independently awarded LEED Certification. </P></dd>
</dl>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">4. APPLICATION AND RATING SYSTEM.</SPAN> </P>

<dl class="dlNumber">
	<dt>4.1</dt><dd><P class="ft6">Upon registering Your Project, You will gain access to an electronic application (the “<SPAN class="ft5">Application</SPAN>”) to be used for the sole purpose of applying for precertification or LEED Certification from GBCI. The Application consists of a collection of electronic data entry screens (“<SPAN class="ft5">Forms</SPAN>”) which are specific to the Rating System (defined below) and the particular format of each Project. You may access and submit multiple Applications under this Agreement. You are not required to submit an Application, and may exit the Program at any time.</P></dd>
	
	<dt>4.2</dt><dd><P class="ft6">Each Application is designed to elicit information necessary to determine if a Project complies with the requirements of the LEED Green Building Rating System that You have selected for Your Project to be reviewed under (the “<SPAN class="ft5">Rating System</SPAN>”) and any applicable Minimum Program Requirements (“<SPAN class="ft5">MPRs</SPAN>”) associated with such rating system (collectively referred to herein as “<SPAN class="ft5">Rating System Requirements</SPAN>”). While USGBC will continue to revise the Rating System and the MPRs from time to time, Your Project will be held to the Rating System Requirements that exist at the time Your Project is registered. Regardless, if You are pursuing LEED Certification via the Volume Program, each Volume Project registered under this Agreement will be held to the same Rating System Requirements as Your Prototype. If You are pursuing Certification via the campus approach, each Campus Project will be held to the Rating System Requirements that exist at the time the Campus Project is registered; provided however, with respect to those Rating System Requirements satisfied through the use of a Master Site, each Campus Project will be held to the Rating System Requirements that exist at the time the associated Master Site is registered. </P></dd>
	
	<dt>4.3</dt><dd><P class="ft6">The full text of the Rating System and the MPRs is published and available for review at the USGBC website: <a href="http://www.usgbc.org" target="_blank">http://www.usgbc.org</a>. You hereby represent and warrant that You have fully reviewed and understand the Rating System and MPRs, and You agree to check for updates prior to registering any Campus Projects or Master Sites under this Agreement in the future. </P></dd>
</dl>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">5. CERTIFICATION GUIDE & REFERENCE GUIDE.</SPAN> </P>

<dl class="dlNumber">
	<dt>5.1</dt><dd><P class="ft6">As used herein, the term “<SPAN class="ft5">Certification Guide</SPAN>” refers to “The Guide to LEED Certification” published by GBCI. The Certification Guide contains extensive information and instructions related to the Program including associated policies, processes and guidelines. You agree to comply at all times with the Certification Guide, including all updates and changes provided to You or made available by GBCI from time to time. The Certification Guide is available for review online at the following webpage: <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/cert-guide" target="_blank">http://www.usgbc.org/cert-guide</a>. You hereby represent and warrant that You have fully reviewed and understand the Certification Guide, and You agree to check for updates often.</P></dd>
	
	<dt>5.2</dt><dd><P class="ft6">As used herein, the term “<SPAN class="ft5">Reference Guide</SPAN>” refers to the LEED Green Building Rating System Reference Guide associated with the Rating System selected for Your Project, including the applicable Reference Guide Supplement, if any, which GBCI shall use to interpret and apply the requirements of the Rating System. The Reference Guide and Reference Guide Supplements are available for purchase at the USGBC website: <a href="http://www.usgbc.org" target="_blank">http://www.usgbc.org</a>. USGBC periodically updates the Reference Guide and Reference Guide Supplements by publishing Addenda online on the USGBC website. You agree to comply at all times with the Reference Guide and applicable Reference Guide Supplement, if any, including all changes and Addenda published by USGBC. You hereby represent and warrant that You have fully reviewed and understand the applicable Reference Guide and Reference Guide Supplement, if any, and You agree to check for updates often. </P></dd>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">6. CERTIFICATION REVIEW. </SPAN> </P>

<dl class="dlNumber">
	<dt>6.1</dt><dd><P class="ft6">Upon receipt of Your Application, GBCI will initiate its review to determine if Your Project is eligible for precertification or LEED Certification, and if so, the appropriate level of LEED Certification to be conferred. During a review, GBCI may request additional documentation, resubmission of calculations and any other information GBCI deems relevant. GBCI will strive to meet the review timelines set forth in the Certification Guide (each, a “<SPAN class="ft5">Review Timeline</SPAN>”); however, the Review Timelines are estimates only. GBCI’s failure to meet any Review Timeline will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and You will not be entitled to any remedy, including a refund of any portion of any Fees paid by You under this Agreement. Further, GBCI’s failure to meet any Expedited Review Timeline provided in the Certification Guide will not be considered a breach of this Agreement and You will not be entitled to any remedy under this Agreement; however, GBCI will refund any premium fees paid by You to expedite the review.</P></dd>
	
	<dt>6.2</dt><dd><P class="ft6">You recognize and acknowledge that GBCI is a nonprofit organization engaged in the effort to lessen the environmental impacts of buildings and communities, and that the Program, while regulated by specific policies and standards developed by GBCI and USGBC, also requires discretion and judgment. The decision whether to grant or deny precertification or LEED Certification to a Project will be made in the sole discretion of GBCI based on GBCI’s interpretation of the Rating System, the sufficiency of the submitted Project Information (defined below), and any other information or factors that GBCI deems relevant. </P></dd>
</dl>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">7. PROGRAM UPGRADES.</SPAN> From time to time GBCI may develop and make available new versions of LEED Online designed to enhance the Application and improve the certification process. You may be allowed to upgrade to a new version of LEED Online as limited in the Certification Guide. If You are entering into this Agreement with the intention of upgrading (meaning, registering a Project in this version of LEED Online that has been previously registered under another version) You understand and agree that this Agreement will supersede, extinguish and take the place of any and all agreements You have previously entered into with GBCI regarding the registration, precertification, or certification of Your Project(s) with respect to all of Your and GBCI’s liabilities, obligations and receipt of benefits under those agreements. You agree that the additional benefits to You and to GBCI provided under this Agreement constitute good and valuable consideration and that this Agreement comprises a valid novation with regard to any prior agreements entered into regarding any Project registered under this Agreement. </P>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">8. OPTIONAL SERVICES.</SPAN> GBCI and/or USGBC may make available certain optional services to assist You to complete the Application, apply the Rating System requirements to Your Project, confirm Your status as a participant in the Program, and/or confirm the status or progress of Your Project, including without limitation, the review of and response to credit interpretation requests and/or LEED interpretations, the review and/or precertification of additional credits or alternative compliance paths, the registration and review of pilot credits, the review and approval of corrective action reports, the undertaking of additional audits, the drafting and transmittal of a letter of support, the undertaking of appeals, and other services related to the Program (collectively, “<SPAN class="ft5">Optional Services</SPAN>”). You acknowledge and agree that the performance of all Optional Services by GBCI, GBCI’s subcontractors and/or USGBC shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation, all provisions herein related to indemnification and limitations of liability.</P>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">9. FEES. </SPAN> </P>

<dl class="dlNumber">
	<dt>9.1</dt><dd><P class="ft6">In consideration for GBCI’s review of Your Project Information (defined below) and the provision of any Optional Services that You request under this Agreement, You agree to pay GBCI certain fees in accordance with the LEED Certification Fees (the “<SPAN class="ft5">Fee Schedule</SPAN>”), (collectively, the “<SPAN class="ft5">Fees</SPAN>”). The Fee Schedule is available for review online at the following webpage: <a href="http://www.usgbc.org/cert-guide/fees" target="_blank">http://www.usgbc.org/cert-guide/fees</a>. The Fees that You will incur will vary depending on the manner in which You pursue LEED Certification and the amount of Optional Services You request. GBCI will invoice You for all applicable Fees as they are incurred. All Fees must be paid within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of GBCI’s invoice. You hereby represent and warrant that You have fully reviewed and understand the Fee Schedule, and You agree to check for updates often.</P></dd>
	
	<dt>9.2</dt><dd><P class="ft6">GBCI reserves the right to increase the Fees by no more than twenty seven percent (27%) per calendar year. You agree to pay the then-current fees as they are incurred. GBCI will provide You with no less than ninety (90) days prior written notice of any Fee increases. You may elect to pay any Fees in advance. If You pay any Fees in advance, You will not be charged for the difference should a subsequent increase occur. If You do not agree to any of GBCI’s Fee increases, Your sole remedy is to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(a). In the event You elect to terminate this Agreement, You will forego any benefit for which You have paid in advance, and GBCI will not be required to provide You with any refund. </P></dd>

<P class="pdefault ft6"><SPAN class="ft4">10. PROJECT INFORMATION.</SPAN> In order to complete the LEED Certification application process, You must submit extensive information to GBCI related to the Project, including without limitation, any information related to You or Your Project provided prior to executing this Agreement, information contained within the Application(s) and any additional information or data provided to GBCI in connection with the Project (collectively, “<SPAN class="ft5">Project Information</SPAN>”). You hereby grant GBCI, GBCI’s subcontractors and USGBC a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up and irrevocable license to access, view, reproduce and otherwise use all Project Information submitted to GBCI, including all copyrighted materials, trademarks and other proprietary information, for the purposes of assessing the Project. This license also grants GBCI and USGBC the right to use, reproduce, publish, create derivative works from, perform and display such Project Information as described in the Certification Guide. GBCI and USGBC reserve the right to change the ways they use and disclose Project Information regarding Your Project; provided however, GBCI will provide You with no less than ninety (90) days prior written notice of any changes.</P>

<P class="p5 ft6">Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent USGBC or GBCI from disclosing information, including where legally compelled to do so by duty, order or command under color of law. Unless prohibited by law, prompt notice of any compelled disclosure will be provided to You to facilitate an opportunity to limit or prevent such disclosure at Your sole expense. Without limitation, GBCI and/or USGBC may disclose Project Information if such disclosure, in GBCI’s or USGBC’s sole discretion, is deemed to be in the interest of public safety. </P>

<P class="p5 ft6">GBCI does not wish to receive classified information. Any information or material submitted to GBCI will be deemed not to be classified. By submitting information to GBCI, You represent that such information, be it submitted in connection with an Application for LEED certification or otherwise, is not controlled for export under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. Part 120 et seq., or the Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Part 730 et seq. </P>
